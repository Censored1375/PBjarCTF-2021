- I've come accross these kinds of challenge before, although i didnt solve them i know where to find a writeup 

One from wormcon https://base64ctf.com/forensic_wormon/

- The Challenge asks for the name of email sender, as u can see in the write up, the name is next to `From:`

```
strings mem_file | grep From:
